Project Title: Introduction to MongoDB

Author: Luis Angelo Viloria

Code Description: This program simulates a basic website with back-end functions. It can save, edit, and delete students in a database. This program utilizes MongoDB for its database.

How to use: The users must have MongoDB Compass installed in their workspace for this application to work. To run, open up two terminals and type "node server.js" in one terminal and "node request.js" in the other. The request.js file ends with deleting all of the users in the database so if you want to check if the save and edit functions are working, comment out the code block dedicated for deleting all users.
